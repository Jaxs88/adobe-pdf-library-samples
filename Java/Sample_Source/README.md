# Java Sample Programs
## ***Introduction***
The Adobe PDF Library (APDFL) is an Application Programming Interface (API) designed to allow programmers to work with the Adobe PDF file format.  The APDFL Software Development Kit (SDK) provides a method for software developers and vendors to build their own third-party systems that allow them to create, change, process, review, and otherwise work with PDF files. The Library is the same one that Adobe Acrobat is based on.

Datalogics provides a Java interface to the Adobe PDF Library. This Interface offers a set of modules for the Library that allow programmers working in Java to take advantage of Adobe PDF Library tools and resources. This interface encapsulates the original Adobe PDF Library; the interface allows you to work with the original library functions directly, and seamlessly, in Java.

## ***The Sample Programs***
The Adobe PDF Library supports Java, and provides a set of sample Java program files, stored under /Java/Sample_Source.

Many of these sample programs automatically generate an output file or set of files.  These output files, generally PDF or graphics files (JPG or BMP), are stored in the directory where the application has been run.

## ***Maven***
The Java sample programs in the Adobe PDF Library are distributed as a Maven project.
