# C++ Sample Programs
## ***Introduction***
The Adobe PDF Library (APDFL) is an Application Programming Interface (API) designed to allow programmers to work with the Adobe PDF file format.  The APDFL Software Development Kit (SDK) provides a method for software developers and vendors to build their own third-party systems that allow them to create, change, process, review, and otherwise work with PDF files. The Library is the same one that Adobe Acrobat is based on.

## ***The Sample Programs***
The Adobe PDF Library is a C/C++ interface. It provides a set of sample C++ program files, stored under /CPlusPlus/Sample_Source.

Many of these sample programs automatically generate an output file or set of files.  These output files, generally PDF or graphics files (JPG or BMP), are stored in the directory where the application has been run.
