# adobe-pdf-library-samples
This repository provides public access to the sample programs provided with the Adobe PDF Library, a product of Datalogics, Inc. The Adobe PDF Library (APDFL) is an Application Programming Interface designed to allow programmers to work with the Adobe PDF file format. APDFL provides a method for software developers and vendors to build their own third-party systems that allow them to create, change, process, review, and otherwise work with PDF files. You could think of APDFL as a means for developers to add features and functions provided with the Adobe Acrobat software to their own custom applications.

We offer three types of sample programs, C++, Java, and .NET. The .NET programs are offered in C#, but you can use any language supported by Microsoft .NET. We also support .NET Core.

Note that these sample programs are only intended for reference. You wonâ€™t be able to build and run the sample programs found in this repository. To run these samples, you need to download and install the APDFL software.
