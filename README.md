## Adobe PDF Library 

Adobe PDF Library (APDFL) gives you the power to create, manipulate and manage PDF documents for large-scale applications. Built on source code used for Adobe Acrobat for consistency and reliability, APDFL gives you greater control over PDF output and processes. Options in programming languages and platforms let you get started coding quickly.
